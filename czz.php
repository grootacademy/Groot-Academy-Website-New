                                <!-- <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">Why should you learn Spring Framework Programming.</h5>
                                <p>The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application. It can be described as a complete and modular framework. The Spring Framework can be used for all layer implementations of a real time application. It can also be used for the development of a particular layer of a real time application unlike Struts and Hibernate. Once you get under the hood of Spring, you will learn how Spring beans, the application context, dependency injection, and Spring Boot work together. Finally you will learn how to define, store, and edit information in your database using JPA and H2 technology..</p>

                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">1: What is Auto Layout?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:Auto Layout is a system provided by Apple to define rules for how your user interface elements should be laid out on different screen sizes and orientations.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">2: How do I submit an app to the App Store?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:To submit an app to the App Store, you need to enroll in the Apple Developer Program, follow the App Store guidelines, prepare your app for submission, and use App Store Connect to submit your app for review. </p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">3:What is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in hybrid application? </h5>
                        <p>Ans: MVC is a design pattern commonly used in hybrid application development. It separates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (manages user input and updates the model and view).</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">4: How do I handle user input in hybrid application apps?</h5>
                        <p>Ans: User input in hybrid application apps is handled through gestures, touch events, and controls. You can use gesture recognizers and delegate methods to respond to user interactions.</p>

                        <p>Ans: Core Data is a framework provided by Apple for data management and storage in hybrid application and macOS applications. It enables developers to work with data in terms of objects, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">6: What is the AppDelegate in an hybrid application application?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:The AppDelegate is a crucial part of an hybrid application app. It contains methods that respond to lifecycle events such as app launch, termination, and entering the background. It also initializes the app and sets up initial configurations.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">7:What are Provisioning Profiles and Certificates?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:Provisioning Profiles and Certificates are used for code signing in hybrid application development. They ensure that your app can be installed and run only on devices specified in the provisioning profile and are essential for testing and distribution.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">8:How can I handle asynchronous tasks in hybrid application?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:Asynchronous tasks, such as network requests or file operations, are commonly handled using closures, completion handlers, or async/await in Swift. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is also a powerful tool for managing concurrent tasks.</p>
