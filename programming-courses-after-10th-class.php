              <br/>
              <h6>In my opinion your college from where you have taken your under graduation plays a huge role in your career because, college faculty & professors not only help in teaching the subject and solving the doubts of the students related to the concept but they also play a huge role in inspiration and helping students improve the life and gain self confidence in themselves, college infrastructure, facilities, fests, events, student clubs are also important to learn & explore new things, make new friends & gain new skills, college is important because of placements and job opportunities because companies like to hire students from top colleges as admission in these top colleges is hard compared to others so the students must be good & skilled for jobs.

              <br/>
              <h6>After you get into the college and after sometime like 6-7 months, in my opinion you should definitely start learning and practicing programming languages. This is more important for the students who are taking degree courses like BSC CS or BCA because their course is only three years long compared to computer science or information technology Engineering which is four years long. It is very important that you learn and practice coding and programming languages properly because skills are more important than degrees and there are many top tech companies like Google, Apple and IBM hiring people based on the skills irrespective of whether they have the college degree or not. Similarly in my opinion you should try to learn, practice and master at least one programming language which can be like Java or python or even Javascript..</h6>
