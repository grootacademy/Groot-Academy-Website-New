										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Do you know Python is a Multipurpose language- Let’s see How?</strong></h2>
<p>Are you looking for a new appealing language? Well, Then python is the best choice for you. The language was introduced by the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It is considered as a free language where a person can work commercially as well as personally. Further, it can be used by programmers as well as non- programmers. With the help of python, one can develop a simple small application to a big one.</p>
<p>The first version of this language was published in the year 1991 named alt.sources which was considered as python 1. Then in the year 2000, the new version was introduced Python 2 but 2.X were more reliable and also more useable till the year2008.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Now let us discuss why Python is known as a Multipurpose language??</em></strong></h3>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4><strong>Interpreted Language</strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other languages such as C which first performed the compilation task and then the code is run. Although the time is considered just in milliseconds, the Python language has an advantage over this. It has interpreted language which means the code is directly sent to the interpreted and further makes the development process much faster.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h4><strong>Portable language</strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In python, you do not need to compile the whole code. Since one platform can run on any other platform because it has a feature of an in-built interpreter.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h4><strong>Popularity</strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A huge community is just getting attached to this language. People learn this language and become a python expert. Moreover, they are helping the learners to easily understand and learn this language and become pro.</p>
