                                <p>The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application. It can be described as a complete and modular framework. The Spring Framework can be used for all layer implementations of a real time application. It can also be used for the development of a particular layer of a real time application unlike Struts and Hibernate. Once you get under the hood of Spring, you will learn how Spring beans, the application context, dependency injection, and Spring Boot work together. Finally you will learn how to define, store, and edit information in your database using JPA and H2 technology..</p>

                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">1: What is React Native?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. This means that the same codebase can be used to develop apps for both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">2:How does React Native differ from traditional native app development?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:Unlike traditional native app development, where separate codebases are required for iOS and Android, React Native enables the development of cross-platform applications using a single codebase. This can lead to increased efficiency and faster development cycles. </p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">3:What are the key advantages of using React Native?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:React Native offers advantages such as code reusability, a faster development cycle, and the ability to use web development skills to build mobile applications. It also provides a hot-reloading feature, allowing developers to see the immediate results of their code changes.</p>
                        <h5 class="text-gradient text-primary mb-0 mt-2">4:Is React Native suitable for all types of mobile applications?</h5>
                        <p>Ans:React Native is well-suited for a wide range of applications, including business apps, social media apps, e-commerce apps, and more. However, for applications with complex, platform-specific features, native development might still be preferred.</p>
